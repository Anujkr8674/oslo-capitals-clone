Prices change over time and the frequency with which they do varies with different financial instruments and market conditions. Oslo Capitals LLC places signification importance when executing Client’s orders to the speed of the execution of an order.As an example, the use of wireless connection or dial up connection or any other communication link that may result in a poor internet connection can lead to an unstable connectivity on the Company’s trading platform resulting to the client orders being received at old prices, where the principal might decline and offer the Client a new quote (commonly referred to as re-quote).<b>7.4 Likelihood of execution- Medium Relative Importance.</b>The volatility levels in the financial market influence both price and volume. Oslo Capitals LLC intends to provision its clients with the fastest execution reasonably possible. Client orders (Buy Limit, Buy Stop, Sell Limit, Sell Stop, Stop loss and/or Take Profit) are executed through Oslo Capitals LLC at the requested price. Howbeit, under certain market conditions, orders may not be filled at the exact price requested but instead at the best available price. This usually occurs during news announcements (fundamentals), during periods or volatile market conditions, on opening gaps (When trading sessions starts) or on possible gaps where the underlying instrument has been suspended or restricted on a particular market.Oslo Capitals LLC strives to provide the best possible price to its clients by making an effort to ensure it has all necessary arrangements in place to do so, but it cannot guarantee the execution of any of the pending orders at the requested price.<b>7.5 Likelihood of Settlement- Low Relative Importance.</b>Oslo Capitals LLC proceeds with the settlement of a clients transaction subject to the successful execution of the respective transaction.<b>7.6 Size of order- Low Relative Importance.</b>The quantity of an order is measured in lot sizes, the fraction of a lot size is commonly referred to as a micro lot. All orders are placed in lot sizes and a lot is considered as a unit measuring the transaction amount which differs in respect to the financial instrument. Contract specifications insofar as lot sizes are available on the Company’s website.If the client wished to execute a large size order, in some cases the price may become less favourable considering the liquidity in the market. Oslo Capitals LLC reserves the right not to accept a client order, in case the size of the order is large and cannot be filled by the Company.<b>7.7 Nature of Order- Low Relative Importance.</b>The characteristics of an order in so far as the underlying instrument, fee type applicable, type of order and distinguishing characteristics collectively sum the nature of an Order.<b>7.8 Market Impact- Low Relative Importance</b>.The quoted prices may be affected by several factors which could also be a result of the above-mentioned parameters. The Company’s takes an approach in consideration of the best possible result for its clients. As stated above, Oslo Capitals LLC will always take all reasonable steps to ensure the best possible result for its clients.Oslo Capitals LLC does not consider the above list of parameters to be exhaustive. The order in which they are presented however, indicates their relative importance in the best execution process without excluding the possibility of derogation from the above-mentioned process in cases where the best interests of the client criterion justify such derogations.</p>
      
      <strong>8. Best Execution Criteria.</strong>
      <p>Oslo Capitals LLC will generally consider the following best execution criteria in order to determine the relative importance of the above-mentioned execution factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The characteristics of the client, which includes the categorisation of the client as retail or professional;</li>
        <li>The characteristics of the client order;</li>
        <li>The characteristics of the financial instruments that are subject to that order;</li>
        <li>The characteristics of the execution venue to which that order can be and will be directed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The total consideration of these characteristics will determine the best possible result, by factoring the price of the contract and the execution costs as the primary factors. Other execution factors like speed, likelihood of execution size, nature or any other relevant considerations will usually be secondary to price and cost considerations, unless they deliver the best possible result for the client in terms of total considerations.</p>
      <strong>9. Effect of other facts on the execution of an order.</strong>
      <p>Client may experience widened spreads and execution at the best available price under certain market conditions (for example, fundamental or news announcements, where there is a fast-moving market or low liquidity). In such circumstances, the principal reserves the right to modify Oslo Capitals LLC spread.Some trades maybe automatically priced and executed by the principal’s automated internal trading systems. Nonetheless, depending on the factors like unusual market conditions, the size and nature of client orders, a financial instrument may be manually priced and/or an order may be manually executed.Manual pricing and/or execution may result in the processing delays of an order during times of high demand, which in turn impacts the price and speed at which the order is executed. Oslo Capitals LLC is committed to providing the most competitive trading technology as an intermediary passing through orders and is always striving to implement measures to minimize the risk delays.In circumstances of any communication technical failure, as well as any incorrect reflection on the quotes fee, The principal reserves the right not to execute an order nor change the opening and/or closing price of a order.Where the Principal transmits the clients order to the liquidity Providers for execution, the order may be executed against the Liquidity providers or executed within the ECN of the liquidity Provider(s).</p>

      <p>The obligation to take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result for a client to the extent that it executes an order, or a specific aspect of an order, following specific instructions from the client relating to the order or the specific aspect of the order should be observed.In circumstances where the client provides Oslo Capitals LLC with a specific instruction as to how to execute an order and Oslo Capitals LLC has accepted this instruction, then Oslo Capitals LLC will pass through the order in accordance with that specific instruction. An order following specific instructions from the client, it should be treated as having satisfied its best execution obligations only in respect of the part or aspect of the order to which the client instructions relate.Nevertheless, if the client provides a specific instruction to carry out an order, then by executing that order, Oslo Capitals LLC will be complying with the Company’s duty to provide the client with best execution. This may result in being unable to apply this Policy in certain instances; howbeit specific instructions which cover one part or aspect of the order should not give prerogative to derogate from best execution obligations in respect of any other parts or aspects of the client order that are not covered by such specific instructions.</p>
      <strong>11. Execution Venue.</strong>
