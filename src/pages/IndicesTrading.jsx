      {/* Index Trading Explanation */}
      <section className="indices-explanation">
        <h2>What is Index Trading?</h2>
        <div className="indicestrading">
        <div className="indicetrade1">
        <p>Stock market indices give the measure of a specific stock market. They represent the value of a group of stocks from a country, and represents the overall, current and historic performance of a specific set of stocks. The calculated value of the stock index is used by investors as an indicator of the current value of their component stocks. Investors can find out the expected returns over time by comparing the current and historic index levels.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="indicetrade2">
            <p>Every stock exchange in the world has a benchmark stock index, while some have several. These baskets of individual stocks are often ranked by independent institutions, like major banks or specialist companies like the FTSE Group or the Deutsche B√∂rse. They also come in different sizes. For instance, the FTSE 100 tracks the share price of the top 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, in terms of market capitalisation. The ASX 200 tracks the share price of the 200 top companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), while the SPI 200 futures contract is a benchmark equity index futures contract, based on the ASX 200 index.</p><br/>
            <p>It is impossible to track all the companies listed on a stock exchange, which is why traders resort to index trading. Through trading indices, they are able to measure the overall performance of the stock market of the country and the economy in general. Traders speculate on the price movements of these financial instruments indices to earn returns when the indices rise in value.</p>
        </div>

        </div>
        
      </section>

      <div className="example">
          <h1>An Example of Indices CFD Trading</h1>
          <p>Suppose you want to trade CFDs, where the underlying asset is the US30, known as ‚Äò‚ÄôDow Jones Industrial Average Index ‚Äù Let us suppose that the US30 is trading at:</p>
        </div>


        <div className="profitloss">
          <div className="profit">
            <p>You decide to buy 5 contracts of US30 because you think that the US30 price will rise in the future. Your margin rate is 0.5%. This means that you need to deposit 0.5% of the total position value into your margin account.</p>
          <img src="/images/indired.png" alt="loss"/>
           
          </div>

          <div className="loss">
            <p>In the next hour, if the price moves to 35849/35852, you have a winning trade. You could close your position by selling at the current (bid) price of US30 which is 35849</p>
            <img src="/images/indigreen.png" alt="loss"/>
          </div>
         </div>

         <div className="inditext">
            <p>In this case, the price moved in your favor. But, had the price declined instead, moving against your prediction, you could have made a loss. This continuous evaluation of price movements and resultant profit/loss happens daily. Accordingly, it leads to a net return (positive/negative) on your initial margin. In the loss scenario where your Free equity, (account balance + Profit/Loss) falls below the margin requirements (896.6), the broker will issue a margin call. If you fail to deposit the money, and the market moves further against you, when your free equity reach the 50% of your initial margin the contract will be closed at the current market price, known as ‚Äústop out‚Äù.</p><br/>
            <p>Notice how a small difference in price can offer opportunities to trade? This small difference is known as ‚Äúpip‚Äù or ‚Äúpercentage in point‚Äù. For Indices trading, 1 pip is equal to a price increment of 1.0 which is also called an Index point.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Index Trading</h2>
        <div className="indi-benifits">
            <div className="indi-benifits1">
                <p>With thousands of stocks trading across different exchanges, stock indices provide an accurate and reliable way to gauge the overall market sentiment. They can also act as benchmarks against individual stock portfolios.</p>
                <p>They can offer exposure to an entire sector in a country. You do not have to perform thorough research on individual companies and other fundamentals. You can simply take a bullish or bearish position, depending on the overall market direction. They reduce the risk of a single company‚Äôs performance impacting your entire portfolio.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="indi-benifits2">
                <p>Price movements of indices are smoother, since individual stock performances cannot lead to intense spikes in volatility. But this volatility is sufficient for you to pick out numerous trading opportunities. There is a lot of activity that happens on individual stocks to produce ample index volatility. Indices trading can be suitable to traders of all styles and a variety of trading strategies, since indices reflect the broader effects of economic and political shifts.</p>

      <section className="indices-dividends">
        <h2>Dividends Adjustments</h2>
        <p>
        If you hold an open Long position on a Cash Index CFD contract that pays a dividend, you will be entitled to an amount equal to the amount based on the number of contracts you hold after the close of the business day before the ex-dividend date.</p>
        <p>Conversely, if you hold an open Short position in a Cash Index CFD which pays a dividend, you will be required to pay an amount based on the number of contracts you hold after the close of the business day before the ex-dividend date. This adjustment may be made either as a cash adjustment into your MetaTrader 5 trading account or included into the end of day swap rate.</p>

        <section className="stock-indices-calculation">
        <h2>How are Stock Market Indices Calculated?</h2>
        <p>Financial experts and investors use a range of different methods to calculate Stock Indices. Some of the more popular methods are:</p>
        <div className="method-cards">
            <div className="method-card">
            <h3>Market Capitalisation Weighted Method</h3>
            <p>In this method, the stocks listed on the Index are weighted using the market capitalisation of each company. The S&P 500 and ASX 200 are major Indices that employ this method.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="method-card">
            <h3>The Equal Weighted Method</h3>
            <p>As indicated by its name, equal weightage is given to all the stocks based on their returns. The returns on each stock are calculated, added together and then divided by the total number of stocks on the Index.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="method-card">
            <h3>The Price Weighted Method</h3>
            <p>This model uses the price of applicable stocks to get a weighted average. Stocks with a higher share price are given greater weight, irrespective of market capitalisation. The Dow Jones in the United States uses the price weighted method.</p>
