            Commodities are essentially the raw materials from which other goods are created; the basic building blocks of the global economy. Consequently, they often serve as an excellent investment vehicle. Commodities fall into two broad categories: hard commodities and soft commodities.<br/><br/>

            Hard commodities are those that are mined from the earth or extracted from natural resources. This category includes metals such as gold, silver and iron, and energies such as oil, natural gas and coal. Soft commodities are agricultural products such as livestock and crops. The commodity markets are popular among traders. This is because they are highly volatile, a feature that provides traders with greater opportunities for success. What separates commodities from other goods is the fact they are interchangeable and standardised, with their values set by the relevant commodity exchange.<br/><br/>

            However, when it comes to commodities trading, not all commodities are equal.

            <p >When trading commodities, liquidity is the primary thing you should consider. This is because liquidity determines the ease with which you can sell or buy a commodity. A liquid market is generally associated with relatively lower risk as there will likely be someone willing to take the other side of a trading position. A good commodity will usually have a well-established market of buyers and sellers at any given time.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p  >Highly liquidity also means that a commodity will have less risk of slippage. Slippage refers to the losses that occur when bid-offer spreads are wide and it‚Äôs a common occurrence among commodities that exhibit low degrees of liquidity. Liquidity differentiates the most-traded commodities from the rest of the flock. This leads us to an all-important question.</p>

Popular commodities include the West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent Crude Oil (XTI), Gold (XAU) and other precious metals, and soft commodities such as Wheat, Coffee, Cocoa, Soya etc. Price movements in commodities are relatively slow and are usually seen as bellwethers and market indicators for the overall health of the industry that produces and consumes them.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Commodity prices can be impacted by various factors, including adverse weather and seasonal availability, natural disasters, severe climate changes and other non-market factors generally found in other financial instruments. Typically, trading in commodities can be either speculative or for hedging purposes. Traders can trade commodity markets to express their outlook on certain industries, or to hedge their trading portfolio by taking an opposite position in a commodity to offset potential losses Hedging as a risk management strategy has its purpose to minimize potential losses but could also result in reducted returns.</p>

            <h2>Gold Markets</h2>
            <p>Throughout history, gold has always been seen as a valuable commodity, and for good reason. In addition to being an in-demand precious metal in many industries, gold is an ideal hedge for financial market risks, especially during periods of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. There is generally strong global market demand for gold making it one of the most actively traded commodities in the world.</p><br/><br/>
            <p>If you want to trade gold, there are several options open to you. You can directly invest in physical gold by purchasing gold bullion from bullion dealers or through gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold the commodity. Alternatively, you can trade gold through ETFs that track the movements of the commodity or purchase gold CFDs (contracts for difference) which track the asset‚Äôs underlying price. The latter is one of the most popular ways of trading gold and it‚Äôs quite easy to see why when you know how trading gold CFDs works.</p><br/><br/>
            <h2>Wheat Markets</h2>
            <p>Wheat is one of the most important food components and is cultivated globally. This grain has always piqued investors‚Äô interests because it allows them to participate in the agricultural markets by trading wheat CFDs without holding actual tons of it. Wheat commodity trading can take place on several exchanges but there are two main that are listed in wheat futures: Chicago Board of Trade and NYSE Euronext. Wheat futures prices are quoted in USD and cents (USD) per bushel.</p><br/><br/>
            <p>The countries producing the biggest quantity of wheat are the European Union with 152,000 thousand metric tons annually, China with 133,600 and India with 106,210. These three countries are amongst the largest producers of wheat worldwide. The countries with the highest consumption of wheat are China with 131,000 thousand tons, India with 96,725 and Australia using the wheat for feeding their masses of livestock.</p>
                
            </div>

          <div className="commodities-text2">
            <h2>Oil Markets</h2>
            <p>Crude oil is a liquid in the Earth, and it is made of hydrocarbons, organic compounds, and tiny amounts of metal. There are many types of crude produced around the world, and the quality of each is reflected in the value. One of its quality characteristics is the sulfur content, which can be defined as sweet or sour, and density ranges from heavy to light. If crudes are light and sweet, there are more expensive as opposed to energy products such as diesel and gasoline. There is a high demand for these grades since they can be processed with refineries requiring less energy.</p><br/><br/>
            <p>Many types of crude oil differ in their consistency and density, depending on how and where it is extracted. There are over 160 types of crude oil traded on the market, but Brent Crude and WTI serve the most as the oil benchmarks in the global markets. The WTI oil is taken from Wells in the United States and sent to Oklahoma by pipeline. It is mostly referred to as US crude, and it has expensive shipping costs when there is demand around the world. The WTI oil is very sweet and light, making it ideal for gasoline refining. WTI is a higher quality crude than Brent, and it is always priced at a premium.</p><br/><br/>
            <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is a cartel of 14 major oil-producing nations seeking to manage the supply of the commodity to control its prices. When there is a meeting on whether to boost or cut production, it can impact current and future prices directly, and oil watchers globally closely follow the announcements. Another important factor affecting the prices is the major crude reports from the US inventory number as higher inventories will mean less demand from the international markets and will pressure the prices lower. Political factors or wars in oil-producing nations are a major issue in the oil markets and natural disasters such as hurricanes that affect major oil infrastructures.</p><br/><br/>
            <h2>Coffee Markets</h2>
            <p>Coffee has become one Œøf the world‚Äôs most profitable commodities. By the 18th century, its cŒønsumptiŒøn and popularity increased significantly in the US during the Civil war. Arabica and Robusta are two different coffee varieties. Arabica is considered a more flavourful bean, with less caffeine and is premium attracting a higher market price. Robusta contains more caffeine and has a bitter taste. Trend followers like to trade Robusta due to its volatility, and traders who prefer more stability choose Arabica.</p><br/><br/>
            <p>The price of coffee can be affected by factors such as changing weather conditions, distribution costs, geopolitics, global health issues and the strength of the US dollar. Also, the price of coffee is moved by factors that relate to supply and demand. Major coffee chains in China increased the price of beverages amid rising costs and inflation. Luckin Coffee, Starbucks and Tim Hortons raised prices by between 1 yuan ($0.16) and 3 yuan ($0.47) according to mobile apps and online menus. Starbucks operates more than 5,500 stores in China and after its first-quarter reporting in February 2022, cautioned that rising inflation and staff shortages continued to present a challenging trading environment globally.</p>

        <h2>How to Trade Commodities?</h2>
        {/* <br/> */}
        <p>
        There are several ways to trade commodities such as precious metals and oil. As they are a physical product, investors have the option of purchasing precious metals such as gold, silver and palladium. One of the main hurdles of doing so is the cost associated with storing such a valuable product.</p><br/>
        <p>This is one of the reasons why commodity futures trading emerged. Through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), you are able to enter into an agreement to buy or sell shares of an underlying ETF at an agreed price prior to a specified date. Many large corporations use futures markets to hedge against market volatility.</p><br/>
        <p>Oslo Capitals offer CFD trading in commodities where you do not own the underlying asset and enter into a contract which, unlike futures contracts, do not have a specified end date.
